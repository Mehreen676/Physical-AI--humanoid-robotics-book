# ChapterWriter Skill

## Purpose
Generates complete, high-quality textbook chapters in MDX format for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics interactive textbook. Produces production-ready content with pedagogical rigor, code examples, diagrams, and assessments.

## Inputs

```yaml
chapter_title:
  type: string
  description: "Title of the chapter (e.g., 'ROS 2 Publishers and Subscribers')"
  required: true

module_number:
  type: integer
  description: "Module number (1-4)"
  required: true

chapter_number:
  type: integer
  description: "Chapter number within module"
  required: true

audience_level:
  type: string
  enum: [beginner, intermediate, advanced]
  description: "Target audience level for depth and complexity"
  required: true

learning_outcomes:
  type: array<string>
  description: "3-5 learning outcomes students should achieve"
  example:
    - "Understand publisher-subscriber pattern in ROS 2"
    - "Create and run a custom ROS 2 node"
  required: true

key_concepts:
  type: array<string>
  description: "5-8 core concepts to cover"
  example:
    - "Topics", "Message types", "Quality of Service"
  required: false

code_language:
  type: string
  enum: [python, cpp, python+cpp]
  description: "Programming language for code examples"
  default: python
  required: false

include_external_refs:
  type: array<string>
  description: "External references (ROS 2 docs, papers, tutorials)"
  required: false
```

## Output

Complete MDX chapter file with the following structure:

```mdx
---
id: module-X-chapter-Y
title: Chapter Title
sidebar_label: Short Title
sidebar_position: Y
---

import { Quiz, CodeBlock, Diagram, Callout } from '@site/src/components';

## Quality Standards

✅ **Mandatory**
- All code examples are tested and runnable
- Learning outcomes are measurable and clear
- Section headings follow markdown hierarchy (## → ###)
- Code blocks include language specification and title
- Quiz has 5 questions with clear correct answers
- External references are active and accurate
- Content is 2000-3000 words (beginner), 3000-4500 words (intermediate), 4500-6000+ words (advanced)
- MDX syntax is valid (proper imports, component props, JSX)

✅ **Recommended**
- Include ASCII diagrams or Mermaid chart descriptions for complex concepts
- Add "Note", "Warning", or "Tip" callouts using `<Callout>` component
- Provide 2-3 code examples per concept section
- Include video/animation descriptions where helpful
- Add section-by-section quiz to reinforce learning

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Beginner ROS 2 Chapter
```
Input:
  chapter_title: "Introduction to ROS 2 Topics"
  module_number: 1
  chapter_number: 3
  audience_level: beginner
  learning_outcomes:
    - "Understand pub-sub messaging pattern"
    - "Create a publisher node"
    - "Create a subscriber node"
  key_concepts: ["Topics", "Messages", "Nodes", "Quality of Service"]
  code_language: python

Output: 3000-word MDX file with simple explanations, basic code, beginner-friendly quizzes
```

### Example 2: Advanced NVIDIA Isaac Chapter
```
Input:
  chapter_title: "Physics-Based Manipulation in Isaac Sim"
  module_number: 3
  chapter_number: 4
  audience_level: advanced
  learning_outcomes:
    - "Simulate contact dynamics in Isaac Sim"
    - "Configure grasping plugins"
    - "Optimize physics parameters"
  key_concepts: ["PhysX engine", "Contact modeling", "Grasp stability", "Jacobian control"]
  code_language: python+cpp

Output: 5500-word MDX file with research references, optimization techniques, advanced debugging
```
