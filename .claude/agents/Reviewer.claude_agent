4. **Validate bonus criteria**
   - Check all skills are reusable and documented
   - Verify personalization features work end-to-end
   - Audit Urdu translation quality and coverage
   - Confirm Spec-Kit Plus artifacts are complete
   - Calculate estimated bonus multiplier

5. **Integration testing**
   - Frontend ↔ Backend: API calls, authentication, data flow
   - Frontend ↔ RAG Chatbot: Query submission, response rendering
   - Backend ↔ Database: Data persistence, queries, transactions
   - Backend ↔ OpenAI: Embedding generation, chat completions
   - End-to-end: Full user journey from signup to learning

6. **Documentation & reporting**
